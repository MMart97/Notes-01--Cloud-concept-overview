# Key Points:
 - Business drivers such as, ( Capacity Planning, Cost Reduction, Organizational Agility) pushed companies/organizations to utilize cloud environments to fulfill customer needs.
 - The term "cloud" originated as a metaphor for the internet which is a network of networks giving remote access to certain decentralized IT resources.
 - Some UK laws require personal data belonging to UK citizens to be kept within the Uk.
 - "Big Data" refers to massive data sets that contain potentially valuable patterns, trends, and associations.
 - Paas has the same advantages of Iaas but also offers middleware, dev tools, and certain business tools.
 
 
  Quote 1: "Someone is simply giving you that machine, and it's up to you to configure and manage that device."
   - This quote is from Professor Messer's basic cloud computing video, specifically when he's explaining IaaS. I find it interesting because I was unaware that you had to be responsible for that providers device when working with IaaS.
  
  Quote 2: "The overlapping of trust boundaries and the increased exposure of data can provide malicious cloud consumers (human and automated) with greater opportunities to attack IT resources and steal or damage business data." 
   - The concept of trust boundaries exposure is very interesting to me because it displays a whole plethora of precautions and security to take when providing cloud services.
   
   
# New Facts I've learned:
  - Businesss drivers are ulitmately what drove businesses to adapt to new IT climates and in turn gave us "cloud computing"
  - (Lead, Lag, and Match) are all strategies to fulfill proper capacity planning within a company
  - The importance of different cloud deployment models can make or break a company that may be starting up
  - While SaaS offers the complete package for affordable cloud computing, the cloud consumer is limited to the providers maintenance/SLA's
  - Data may be withheld between certain geographical regions of the globe if the laws in said regions dictate so
  
  
# Questions that remain in my mind:
 - Will new laws be made to protect the data of cloud providers/consumers?
 - How does one determine whether to create a fully cloud deployment over a hybrid one.
 - Is it better to have full control of cloud computing maintenance over paying for cloud service provision with strict SLA's?
